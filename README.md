# AdventOfCode2020: Thomas Killian

Advent of Code 2020:
  This is part of some coding practice that I will be partaking in during the summer of 2021.
  I am working COVID Testing at a local university, but have been told that it will be rather slow;
  therefore Advent of Code will take place during the slow portions of the day. The goal is to complete
  Advent of Code over the summer, possible obstacles: vacations, weekends, and pure laziness!

  Day 2: 5/24/21
  
  Day 3: 5/26/21 -- Needed some help (had not seen two variable for loops in python)
  
  Day 4: 6/02/21 -- kept messing up on the second part getting 159 and needed 150, got it now

  Day 5: 6/03/21 -- pretty easy one; had trouble deciding how to start, but after making list ranges it was simple
