# AdventOfCode2020: Thomas Killian

Advent of Code 2020:
  This is part of some coding practice that I will be partaking in during the summer of 2021.
  I am working COVID Testing at a local university, but have been told that it will be rather slow;
  therefore Advent of Code will take place during the slow portions of the day. The goal is to still
  complete the work within ~1 months time, taking in account for vacations, weekends, and pure laziness!
